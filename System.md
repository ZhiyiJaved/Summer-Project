# System Development Progress
My development will be based on this design sketch, and I will keep updating my progress here.

## System Development
### Revolution View
In the last 2 weeks, I developed the `Revolution View` of the System.

The view was designed to support users for interpretability feature selection and manage multiple instances generated from different 
input schemes. In working closely with data scientists, I found that many experienced data scientists resort to tree diagram to document 
their instances. And after communication, I found that data scientists are more interested in the impact of current input schemes. In other words, they hope the differences in the performance of neighboring models can be emphasised.
