# Summer Research Project Plan

## 1. Task Definition and Objectives

Based on early-stage user interviews and [survey results](Interview%20with%20End%20Users/Interview%20with%20Ziming%20Yu/Survey%20Analysis.md), the project aims to address the following core tasks:

1. Enable interpretability-aware feature selection in logistic regression workflows.  
2. Identify and refine nonlinear patterns through interactive feature discretization schemes.  
3. Support agile building, comparison, and management of logistic regression (LR) instances.
