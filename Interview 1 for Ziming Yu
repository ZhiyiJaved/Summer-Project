## 附录：中English访谈逐句对照

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：我操他妈要有要有问题的话就白给了。  

**English**：If something goes wrong, everything we did would be for nothing.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：我不能不能说脏话不能说脏话，不能说脏话，这个这个录制了，OK，好那个，呃， 整个事情的背景，我微信上跟你同步过了然后，但是我这边还是要再强调一下，  

**English**：I shouldn’t swear, I shouldn’t swear—this is being recorded. OK, so, I already synced with you on WeChat, but I still want to emphasize a few things.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：就是这次访谈中学校是未归档的，所以我们提前都要对好流程，然后咨询你， 一会儿签一下我到时候还得问我老师看他是不是要纸质的，  

**English**：This interview hasn’t been officially filed with the school, so we need to align on the process in advance and double-check with you. I’ll also need your signature later, and I’ll check with my professor to see if he needs a printed copy.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：对对。  

**English**：Yeah, yeah.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：然后总之最重要的还是涉及到敏感或者公司机密的，就别讲太细。  

**English**：Anyway, the most important thing is—if it involves anything sensitive or company-confidential, just don’t go into too much detail.

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：要我有风险的话，就比较麻烦嗯。  

**English**：If there's any risk on my side, it could get pretty messy. 

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：指路我有数，该说的我说不该说的学坚决不送。  

**English**：Don’t worry, I know the drill—I'll say what should be said, and firmly skip what shouldn't. 

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：OKOKOKI think，呃，虽然我们之前是一起干过活啊，但是这个还是例行， 问一下就是你现在在蚂蚁主要负责哪块工作？因为呃，相比于之前那种工作来说，  

**English**：> OK OK OK, I think—uh, even though we’ve worked together before, I still want to ask this as a routine: what are you mainly working on at Ant now? Because, compared to the work we did back then…


---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：我这次选择来找你访谈，主要还是关心你现在在蚂蚁对， 在你的那个业务领域上会不会有些什么变化？嗯。  

**English**：The reason I chose to interview you this time is mainly because I’m curious—has anything changed in your area of work at Ant? 

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：嗯，好的好的，呃，我简单介绍一下，我主要还是风控方向， 然后现在更多是在信贷支付相关的业务职责基本上没有根本的变化，但参与度确实深了不少。  

**English**：Sure, let me give a quick intro. I’m still mainly focused on risk control, and now more involved in credit and payment-related business. My core responsibilities haven’t fundamentally changed, but I’m definitely more deeply involved now. 

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：嗯。  

**English**：Yeah.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：参与度深是指哪方面，你是说技术还是说对接面方面啊？  

**English**：What do you mean by “more involved”? Are you talking about the technical side or more on collaboration and communication?  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：呃，其实都有，就以前在字节，我其实主要偏业务，然后模型的细节就是算法， 他们沟通让他们出的，但是呢，现在在蚂蚁的话就是自己要深度参与到模型的，  

**English**：Actually, both. Back at ByteDance, I mainly focused on business—when it came to model details, that was handled by the algorithm team. But now at Ant, I have to get hands-on with the modeling work myself.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：比如说特征分析分享甚至模型的可解释性建设里。  

**English**：For example, I’m involved in feature analysis, variable binning, and even building model explainability.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：要求也比以前高得和能啊，得能和算法法务一起把决策理由给它捋清楚。  

**English**：The bar is much higher now—I need to work with both algorithm and legal teams to clearly lay out the reasoning behind decisions.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：呃，你说特征分析分享，呃，感觉有一种你现在半只脚踏进了算法圈的感觉， 就不只是做业务了是吧？  

**English**：So when you talk about things like feature analysis, it sounds like you’ve got one foot in the algorithm world now—not just doing business anymore, right?  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：嗯。  

**English**：Yeah.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：嗯，差不多刚来的时候确实挺不适应，但现在遇到算法数据团队讨论模型结构， 我自己也能跟上节奏，甚至参与决策。  

**English**：Yeah, at first it was hard to adapt. But now when the algorithm and data teams talk about model structure, I can follow the conversation—and even take part in the decision-making.  


---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：呃嗯，那在你看来，这种模式下模型对风控业务的意义有变化吗？  

**English**：Hmm, so in your view, has the role of models in risk control changed under this new setup?  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：我觉得变化还是挺大的，原来模型只是辅助我们进行决策， 现在很多审批额度调整风风险分分类都直接靠模型定，最重要的是每一步都能说清楚为什么，  

**English**：Yeah, I think the change is pretty significant. Models used to just assist in decision-making, but now they’re directly deciding things like credit approvals, limit adjustments, and risk segmentation. And the key is—we need to be able to explain every step.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：比如说有客户被拒，不能只说模型分低得拆出来，具体是什么特征拉低的分数？  

**English**：Like, if a customer gets rejected, we can’t just say their model score was low—we need to break it down and explain exactly which features dragged the score down.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：呃，所以你的意思我可不，我可不可以理解为？就是说，呃。 现在对模型的可解释性要求会比以前高很多，因为现在模型就像你说的被应用的场景更多了。  

**English**：So what you're saying is—the demand for model explainability is way higher now, because the models are being used in more and more real decision-making scenarios, right?  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：对。  

**English**：Yeah.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：对对对，尤其是在我们这种金融风控领域，每个变量分享甚至模型决策路径， 都得能对业务合规监管有据可查，我们还得能对客户说清楚为什么被拒，  

**English**：Exactly. Especially in financial risk control, we need to be able to trace every variable and the whole model decision path. It’s got to stand up to business, compliance, and even explain to customers why they were rejected.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：嗯。  

**English**：Got it.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：或者说为什么额度这么给？  

**English**：Or why they got the specific credit limit they did.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：呃，OK就是如果讲清楚的话可能会很麻烦，我大概能get到对， 呃那那你能不能给我一个case？就是什么场景下就是模型解释不清楚。呃，  

**English**：OK, got it. But sounds like explaining everything could get really messy. Can you give me a case—like when the model’s logic wasn’t clear and people didn’t buy it?  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：嗯。  

**English**：Sure.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：然后业务和合规不认的这种情况对我可能会更好，对更更好理解一些。嗯？  

**English**：Especially a case where the business or compliance teams didn’t accept it—that kind of example would really help me understand.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：有的这种情况还挺常见的，我举个例子啊，比如说之前有一版复杂模型，然后算法同学很满意， 说AUC标很高啊，业务和合规一看讲不明白直接就否了，  

**English**：Yeah, that kind of thing actually happens a lot. For example, there was this one complex model version that the algorithm team loved—the AUC looked great—but once business and compliance took a look, they couldn’t understand it and shut it down right away.  
---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：我操。  

**English**：Damn.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：然后最后我们后来还是回馈到解释更清楚的方案。  

**English**：So in the end, we went back and delivered a more explainable version.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：特征贡献度和案例说明，大家才认可。  

**English**：Only after we showed feature contributions and explained with real cases did everyone approve it.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：哦，所以就对于业务和合规来讲，就是你这事儿解释不清楚，哪怕呃效果好，他们也不认啊。  

**English**：Ah, so for the business and compliance folks, even if the model works well—if it’s not explainable, they won’t accept it, right?  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：嗯，对对对。  

**English**：Exactly, yes.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：OK，呃，那如果说能够定制一套业务模型系统，你最想要一些什么功能就是，呃，我想啊， 就是类似于一个可视化系统，也是我之前跟你聊的，我可能想要开发这样一个系统对你，  

**English**：OK, so if we could design a custom system for business modeling—what features would you want the most? I’m thinking about a kind of visualized platform, like I mentioned to you before.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：你觉得哪些功能对于一个自动化生成模型的系统来说是更重要的？对。  

**English**：What do you think are the most important features for a system that automatically builds models?  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：对。  

**English**：Yeah.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：这个问题还挺有意思的。  

**English**：That’s an interesting question.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：呃，在我看来自动生成决策链路变量解释化呃业务话术，呃， 比如说你被拒是因为a加b加C啊。还有就是敏感敏感性分析，  

**English**：In my view, it should include automatic generation of decision chains, variable explanations, and business-facing scripts—for example, “you were rejected because of A + B + C.” Also, sensitivity analysis…  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：比如说特某某个特征一变分数怎么跳，然后最后就是案例回放，能一键对业务合规讲明白。 这种功能我觉得是啊，最想要的。  

**English**：Like, how a score shifts when a certain feature changes. And finally, case playback—being able to walk business or compliance through everything in one click. Those are the functions I’d want most.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：错啊，对。  

**English**：Exactly, right.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：OK，我感觉这个是非常贴合你现在的需求了哦，我要回去想一想，OK，好，呃呃， 现在就是那业务和算法团队之间，你觉得最容易卡住的点是什么？然后怎么化解，  

**English**：OK, I feel like this really fits your current needs. I’ll think about it more. So now, what do you think is the most common point of friction between the business and algorithm teams? And how do you usually resolve it?  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：因为我现在知道你可能是类似于在做一个中间桥梁这样的一个角色嘛。  

**English**：Because I know you’re kind of acting as a bridge between the two sides now, right?  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：对对对，呃，我觉得主要是语言风格不同。  

**English**：Exactly. I think the main issue is the difference in language and communication style.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：嗯。  

**English**：Right.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：业务关心能不能讲明白？  

**English**：Business people care about whether you can explain things clearly.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：办法动态效果大家互不信的时候，我一般让大家拉典型业务的啊。典型用户的case。  

**English**：When no one trusts the methods or dynamic effects, I usually ask everyone to pull up a typical business or user case.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：大家一起看分布化流程，然后这样慢慢建立共识。  

**English**：Then we walk through the distribution and process together—that’s how consensus is built over time.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：明白明白理解，OK，呃呃，其实其实这个这上部分问卷到这部分其实差不多结束了， 然后我也能够大概get到你意思，但是呃，我听下来，我感觉你现在对技术好像了解蛮多的，  

**English**：Got it, got it. Actually, this first part of the interview is pretty much done, and I think I get what you mean. But from what I’ve heard, you seem to understand quite a bit of the technical stuff now.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：嗯。  

**English**：Yeah.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：所以我还想继续呃，就下部分内容跟你讨论一下，然后呃，就看你现在还有空， 因为我看时间应该还没有太长。嗯。  

**English**：So I’d like to continue and talk about the next part, if that’s okay with you—if you still have some time, I mean. It hasn’t been that long yet.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：没事没事，现在不懂点代码都问不下去了，你问吧，你问吧，就别让我当场写SQL就行。  

**English**：No worries. Nowadays, if you don’t know some code, you can’t even ask good questions. Go ahead—just don’t ask me to write SQL on the spot.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：哦，好吧，好吧，OK行那，那我，呃，首先刚我听到你聊到分享就是关于这些什么特征分享， 呃，你们现在是怎么做的，还有包括一些，因为我了解到你做分享，  

**English**：Alright, alright, sounds good. First, you mentioned things like feature sharing—how do you guys approach that now? I heard you’re quite involved in that.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：嗯。  

**English**：Yeah.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：应该大部分情况下是为了做一些非线性特征的识别嘛， 然后包括模型多了以后有什么什么版本管理啊之类的，因为我听下来你是会做一些代码开发的，  

**English**：I assume most of the time it’s for identifying non-linear features, right? And when there are more models, there’s probably stuff like version management too. From what I’ve heard, it seems like you also do some coding.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：对有没有？  

**English**：Am I right?  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：嗯嗯嗯。  

**English**：Yeah, yeah, yeah.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：改过的坑，对我想了解一下这些。  

**English**：Any lessons learned or pitfalls you’ve run into—I’d like to hear about those.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：好的，好好的，呃，分享这块，我们一般先看业务相关性，比如资产活跃行为这些啊， 自动WOE分享后进行人工的这么一个review，然后资产特征对丰富很敏感，  

**English**：Sure, sure. For binning and feature transformation, we usually start with business relevance—for example, asset activity behavior. After automatic WOE binning, we do a manual review. Asset-related features tend to be quite sensitive.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：比如说在余额宝的存款额。  

**English**：For example, the deposit amount in Yu’ebao.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：告别告别告别告别告别告呃具体具体的那个别别说具体具体数字描述相关性就好， 具体数数值别提回头，这个还是要归档的，到时候一查很麻烦呃。  

**English**：Wait wait wait, let’s not mention any actual numbers—just describe the correlation conceptually. We’ll need to archive this later, and it could be a hassle if specifics get checked.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：OKOK。  

**English**：Okay, got it.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：那好的明白明白我细节收着点呃，其实很多业务，呃， 其实很多特征业务逻辑和特征分享是一致的，就是要用分享把风险区间拆的业务能懂，  

**English**：Alright, understood, I’ll hold back on the details. Actually, a lot of the business logic aligns with feature binning—the goal is to break down the risk ranges in a way that business teams can understand.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：但也踩过坑，比如说有些特征分的太细样，本量一下变得很小，模型稳定性就很差啊。 最后还得手动合并分享，我们现在会加样，本量可视化和自动报警功能。  

**English**：But we’ve made mistakes too—for example, when some features were binned too finely, the sample size per bin became too small, which made the model unstable. We had to manually merge bins afterward. Now we’ve added sample volume visualization and automatic warning features.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：哦，也就是，唉，我理解，就是你是在说一种数据的波动啊。由于样本量小， 它的那个测试集我理解是测试员训练集，它的那个效果可能并不是很好。  

**English**：Oh, I see. So you’re talking about data fluctuation—when the sample size is small, even in the test or training set, the performance might not actually be good.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：它可能是一种假的一种拟合状态，所以会导致所谓的过拟合，对吧？  

**English**：It might just be a false fit, right? Which leads to what we call overfitting.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：对对对，就。  

**English**：Exactly, that’s it.  
---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：Okay。  

**English**：Okay.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：嗯，开始业务也不懂啥线性非线性了，算法喜欢甩呃，比如说PDP sharp曲线， 后来大家都看case，然后分析极值。对照分布，我发现有些特征不是越高越好，  

**English**：At first, the business side didn’t really get linear or nonlinear stuff. The algorithm team liked to throw things like PDP sharp curves at them. But later, we all started reviewing cases and analyzing edge values. That’s when I noticed some features aren’t “the higher the better.”  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：而是比如说呃，两头块中间好多用实际案例和可视化就是我们这样的话， 业务就是已经也慢慢能接受。  

**English**：Instead, for some features, the extremes are risky and the middle is safe. Using real cases and visualizations helped the business team gradually understand and accept it.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：那，那我进一步了解一下，就是在你找这个非线性特征过程当中， 你要是遇到了分箱样本太少WOE波动大的情况具体怎么做的？  

**English**：Let me ask a bit deeper—when you're identifying nonlinear features, what do you do if the bins have too few samples and WOE fluctuates too much?  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：除了报纸以外。  

**English**：Besides just throwing alerts.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：你不。  

**English**：Yeah, exactly.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：OKOK，这个问题我之前吃过大亏。  

**English**：Oh yeah, I’ve made some painful mistakes on this.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：就比如说分城市结果某个小城市只有个位数样本模型，结果就极不稳定， 现在我们加了可视化报警，遇到样本少的自动分箱或者不分，  

**English**：Like one time, we binned by city, and a small city only had a handful of samples—made the model super unstable. Now we’ve added visual warnings, and if the sample is too small, it’ll auto-bin differently or skip binning entirely.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：Okay。  

**English**：Okay.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：这样就可以比较好的解决这种问题。  

**English**：That pretty much solves the issue.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：明白，所以也还是一种报警机制，OK，这个我倒是可以考虑进去，那另外就是呃， 有个问题就是模型版本管理怎么做？呃，我刚刚也问了，你好像还没回答，  

**English**：Got it—so it still comes down to an alerting mechanism. I’ll keep that in mind. Another thing I wanted to ask: how do you manage model versions? I think I asked earlier but we didn’t really go into it.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：对有没有出过什么乌龙？  

**English**：Ever had any version control screw-ups?  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：OK，这个是一个很经典的问题啊，就我们早期是全靠excel进行命名的，就肯定也出， 就这个问题就是肯定也出过那种回退错模型的这种乌龙啊。  

**English**：Yeah, classic issue. Early on, we were naming everything manually in Excel, and of course, we ran into dumb mistakes—like rolling back to the wrong model version.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：但现在公司基本上都有这种自动化管理什么参数和日志全记录回复就方便很多， 那具体用啥平平台我这边就不展开讲了啊。  

**English**：Now the company has automated version management—parameters and logs are all recorded, so rollback is much easier. I won’t go into what platform we use specifically though.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：OK类似于git，我了解，嗯。  

**English**：Sounds like Git-style versioning—I get it.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：嗯嗯，对对对。  

**English**：Yeah, exactly.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：如果能够定制一个这种具体模型建模方面的这些系统，呃，你最想要哪些功能？嗯。  

**English**：If you could build a system specifically for modeling, what features would you want the most?  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：呃，这个问题挺有意思，呃。自动分享配解释敏感性分析文本溯源一键回滚和案例分析， 就是要让业务直接明白模型的逻辑模型，再好用不起来也没用。  

**English**：That’s a great question. I’d want auto binning with explainability, sensitivity analysis, text traceability, one-click rollback, and case walkthroughs. The model logic has to be business-friendly—if they can’t use it, even the best model is useless.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：OK理解，我完全理解你的诉求。  

**English**：Totally makes sense. I completely get where you’re coming from.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：对对。  

**English**：Exactly.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：那行，呃，那你觉得你这2年最大的成长是什么？嗯。  

**English**：Alright—so what would you say is your biggest growth over the past two years?  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：嗯，我觉得我这2年对他成长主要就是敢问敢沟通啊，以前遇到不懂的就绕着走， 现在是问到底举例讲到业务也明白为止，呃，业务算法都通畅了，合作自然也就高效了。  

**English**：I’d say the biggest growth is learning to ask questions and communicate directly. I used to avoid things I didn’t understand, but now I ask until I really get it—and I explain with examples until business teams understand too. Once that’s clear, working together just becomes efficient.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：OK。  

**English**：OK.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：OK，那你这就是进化中的业务人的状态啊，有机会请你一起多讲讲互怼经验。  

**English**：Haha, so you’ve evolved into a business person 2.0. We’ve got to find a time for you to share more of those “arguing with tech” war stories.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：OKOK，随时包教包会。  

**English**：Haha, anytime—you name it, I’ll teach everything I know.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：OK那行，那今天就先这样，我觉得问的差不多了，我到时候再争取开发点用。  

**English**：Alright then, let’s call it a day. I think I’ve asked pretty much everything I wanted. I’ll try to build something useful from this later.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：嗯，好嘞，好的，好的，好的，好的，那咱今天就先这样。  

**English**：Yep, sounds good. Let’s wrap up for today then.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：等一下你现在是在加班吗？  

**English**：Wait, are you working overtime right now?  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：啊，对对对，是的。  

**English**：Ah, yeah yeah, I am.  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：不工卡，我看你工卡长啥样了？  

**English**：Show me your work badge—what does it look like?  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：啊。  

**English**：Huh?  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：应该还挺好看的，能看见吗？  

**English**：I think it looks pretty good—can you see it?  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：哦，OK，OK行行行，我回头回头回头一起吃饭，回头回头吃饭。  

**English**：Oh OK, cool cool cool. Let’s grab a meal sometime soon—really.  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：挺好看的吧？  

**English**：Nice-looking, right?  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：啊好嘞，好嘞，好嘞啊好那今天先这样好好好好拜拜拜拜。  

**English**：Alright alright alright—cool, let’s wrap it here. Bye-bye-bye!  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：那些OK？  

**English**：That’s all good?  

---

**发言人**：Jingwei Lin  

**中文**：对吧嗯？  

**English**：Right? Hmm?  

---

**发言人**：Ziming Yu  

**中文**：拜拜。  

**English**：Bye.
